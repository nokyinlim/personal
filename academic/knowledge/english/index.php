            <h4>Mr. Arthur Birling</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>Wealthy factory owner who represents capitalism and self-interest. A stereotypical capitalist businessman.</li>
              <li>More interested in money than in the well-being of others</li>
              <li>Represents the opposite of Priestley's beliefs - he is criticising people like Mr. Birling, and as such, uses <em>Dramatic Irony</em> to undermine this character.</li>
              <li>Highly unlikeable - never admits responsibility for the death of Eva Smith.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="card no-hover-transform cursor-glow-alt glow-error border p-3 rounded">
            <h4>Mrs. Sybil Birling</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>Wife of Mr. Birling, represents the 'cold' of the upper classes, and is narrow-minded and unaware of how other people live.</li>
              <li>Often uses her power and influence to intimidate others, but doesn't work on the Inspector. Highly hypocritical as she also makes prejudiced judgements of the lower class.</li>
              <li>Expresses no sympathy towards death of Eva throughout the play. Her only reaction is when the revelation that it directly relates to her son, Eric Birling.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="card no-hover-transform cursor-glow-alt glow-error border p-3 rounded">
            <h4>Sheila Birling</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li><b>Initially</b>, Sheila is na√Øve, spoilt, representing the upper-class girls. She is '<em>pleased with life</em>', showing that she lives in a narrow world.</li>
              <li>Engaged with <em>Gerald Croft</em>, and celebrating this fact at the start of the play.</li>
              <li>Expresses the most sympathy towards death of Eva throughout the play. She immediately accepts responsibility, and is most transformed by the Inspector's visit, and his final words.</li>
              <li>Through Sheila, Priestley shows the potential for change within the younger generation. She also serves a dramatic purpose - the audience can draw comparisons between her and Eva smith.</li>

            <h4>Eric Birling</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>Initially an awkward outsider, he drinks often and represents spoilt upper / middle class men, who think that they can be selfish and indulgent, without direction nor purpose.</li>
              <li>Voice is ignored and dismissed by parents. This contrasts with the respect the parents show towards Gerald.</li>
              <li>Expresses good sympathy towards death of Eva throughout the play. He is transformed by the inspector, and the audience understands how he seems to have learnt the lesson.</li>
              <li>He seems not to be afraid of his behavior being exposed, and seems to want to face the responsibilities / consequences for his action. He also represents the possibility for change for the audience.</li>

            <h4>Gerald Croft</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li>Engaged to Sheila Birling, represents the upper class and the business elite.</li>
              <li>Had an affair with Eva Smith (Daisy Renton) while being engaged to Sheila.</li>
              <li>Initially appears charming and considerate, but his true character is revealed through the Inspector's interrogation.</li>
              <li>Shows some remorse for his actions, but ultimately sides with the older Birlings in dismissing the Inspector's message.</li>
              <li>Priestley uses Gerald to represent the hypocrisy and moral failings of the upper class.</li>

            <h4>Inspector Goole</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
              <li><b>Primary didactic vehicle</b> for the play, the Inspector is the direct contrast to Mr. Birling's capitalistic views.</li>
              <li>Priestley's mouthpiece, and holds power as an authority figure to the audience, and to the characters.</li>
              <li>A catalyst for change, he is able to get characteres to reveal their involvement, since he seems to already be fully aware of the events that happened, and what they are going to say.</li>
              <li>Ambiguous and supernatural, causing the audience to question the true identity of the Inspector.</li>

          <h5>Thematic Analysis</h5>
          <p class="mb-3">Priestley uses the play to communicate several interconnected themes:</p>
          
          <h6 class="font-bold mt-3">1. Social Responsibility</h6>
          <p>The Inspector represents society's collective conscience, emphasizing that all actions have consequences and we must care for one another. This theme is directly expressed in the Inspector's final speech.</p>
          
          <h6 class="font-bold mt-3">2. Generation Gap</h6>
          <p>The younger generation (Sheila and Eric) are more willing to accept responsibility and change than the older generation (Mr. and Mrs. Birling, Gerald). This represents Priestley's hope for social progress.</p>
          
          <h6 class="font-bold mt-3">3. Class and Privilege</h6>
          <p>The Birlings' treatment of Eva Smith demonstrates how class prejudice allows the wealthy to abuse their power. Eva represents the vulnerable working class exploited by the privileged.</p>
          
          <h6 class="font-bold mt-3">4. Gender Inequality</h6>
          <p>Eva Smith experiences sexism throughout the play (at the factory, department store, and in her relationships with men). Mrs. Birling's charity committee hypocritically judges "fallen women" while protecting powerful men.</p>
          
          <h6 class="font-bold mt-3">5. Time and Reality</h6>
          <p>The play's complex time structure (written in 1945, set in 1912, with knowledge of both world wars) and the ambiguous nature of the Inspector suggest Priestley is playing with reality to deliver his message.</p>
        `;
      } else if (selection === 'context') {
        noteContent.innerHTML = `
          <h5>Historical Context</h5>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
            <li><strong>Setting (1912):</strong> Pre-World War I Britain was characterized by rigid class divisions, gender inequality, and laissez-faire capitalism. The Titanic had just sunk (referenced by Birling), symbolizing the hubris of the era.</li>
            <li><strong>Writing (1945):</strong> Priestley wrote the play immediately after World War II, when Britain was rebuilding and establishing the welfare state. The audience would have experienced both world wars, economic depression, and social reform.</li>
            <li><strong>Priestley's Politics:</strong> J.B. Priestley was a socialist who believed in collective responsibility and social justice. He used his writing to advocate for a more equal society.</li>
            <li><strong>Dramatic Irony:</strong> The audience in 1945 would know that Birling's optimistic predictions (no war, the unsinkable Titanic) were completely wrong, undermining his entire worldview.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-War Rebuilding:</strong> The play was first performed when Britain was creating the NHS and welfare state, directly implementing the kind of social responsibility Priestley advocates.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 class="mt-4">Social Context:</h5>
          <div class="p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">
            <p>In 1912, a factory girl like Eva Smith would have few rights and protections. Women couldn't vote, labor laws were minimal, and there was no welfare system. The play critiques this lack of social support and the selfish individualism that Priestley believed led to both world wars.</p>
