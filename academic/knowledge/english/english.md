    1. *convey, reveal, imply, trivialize, highlight, demonstrate, exemplify, signify, manifest, indicate, suggest, portray, depict, characterize, present, communicate, express, assert, clarify, unveil, delineate, showcase, authenticate, corroborate, frame, establish, substantiate, foster, encapsulates*
